# Week 0 — Billing and Architecture

I had to start again from scratch, the app was not working, my gitpod did not want to start, I restarted my laptop and nothing, I searched for the problem in google and nothing but here I am still trying to improve and learn

I watched like 3 or 4 times the week 0 videos, play, pause, play, pause...

I create the conceptual diagram in Lucid Charts and a napkin![Diagram](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97815671/222918570-14744990-aacf-46c5-9035-48120b842cd1.jpg)
